# MealPlanner Development Rules

## NPM Command Safety
- ALWAYS use timeout with npm commands to prevent blocking operations
- Default timeout: 30 seconds for most npm commands
- Extended timeout: 60 seconds for npm install/update operations
- Use format: `timeout 30s npm run test:run` or `timeout 60s npm install`
- If timeout occurs, investigate the issue and use alternative approaches

## Testing Workflow
- Run tests with timeout: `timeout 30s npm run test:run` (exits immediately)
- For watch mode development: `npm test` (stays running, watches for changes)
- For E2E tests, use: `timeout 60s npm run test:e2e`
- If tests hang, kill processes and investigate root cause
- Always commit passing tests before moving to next milestone

### Playwright Testing - CRITICAL PRACTICES
- **MANDATORY FRESH SESSION**: ALWAYS start with completely fresh Playwright session for every test
- **NEVER reuse browser sessions** - caching and state pollution make results unreliable
- **ALWAYS test against local server** (`http://localhost:8080`) to avoid GitHub Pages caching issues
- **MANDATORY Clean Sandbox Protocol**:
  1. Close existing browser: `mcp_playwright_browser_close`
  2. Kill ALL Chrome processes: `pkill -f chrome`
  3. Wait for cleanup: `sleep 2`
  4. Navigate fresh: `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate` to localhost
  5. Wait for page load before testing
- **Server Management**:
  - Verify local server is running: `ps aux | grep "python3 -m http.server"`
  - Restart server if needed: `pkill -f "python3 -m http.server" && python3 -m http.server 8080 &`
  - Update cache-busting version: `node update-version.cjs` after code changes
- **NEVER test against GitHub Pages during development** - caching makes results unreliable
- **Always verify console messages** for JavaScript errors and version verification
- **Cache-busting verification**: Check that new versions are being loaded in console logs

## Development Milestones
- Each roadmap milestone MUST include:
  1. Implementation of feature
  2. Comprehensive behavior tests
  3. All tests passing (timeout 30s npm test)
  4. Version update (node update-version.cjs)
  5. Commit and push to remote
  6. Verification on live site

## Cache Management
- Use cache-busting version system for all assets
- Update versions after each milestone
- Test both local and remote deployment consistency

## PWA Best Practices
- Maintain static site compatibility
- Ensure offline functionality
- Test installation and service worker behavior
- Secure credential storage for OAuth tokens

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

## Code Quality
- Use semantic search for exploration
- Parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Git Commit Safety
- **ALWAYS use simple, single-line commit messages** to avoid shell quote issues
- **NEVER use multi-line commit messages** with complex formatting in terminal commands
- **Format**: `git commit -m "Simple descriptive message without quotes or special chars"`
- **Avoid**: Emojis, quotes, backticks, or multi-line strings in commit messages via terminal
- **If detailed commit needed**: Use `git commit` (opens editor) instead of `git commit -m`
- **Example Good**: `git commit -m "Fix label system data source consistency"`
- **Example Bad**: `git commit -m "âœ¨ FIX: Label System \"Data Source\" Consistency..."`

## UI/UX Patterns
### Modal Design - CRITICAL PATTERN
- ALWAYS use sticky header/footer pattern for forms with action buttons
- Modal structure: `flex flex-col` + `max-h-[90vh]`
- Header: `flex-shrink-0` (never shrinks)
- Content: `overflow-y-auto flex-1` (scrollable)
- Footer: `flex-shrink-0` (always visible)
- Buttons outside form: use `form="form-id"` attribute
- Applied to: ALL modals with forms (recipe, meal, ingredient, etc.)

### Dropdown Positioning
- Use parent-relative positioning (`absolute` within `relative` container)
- Implement JavaScript viewport-aware positioning
- Check available space and adjust left/right positioning dynamically
- Avoid fixed viewport positioning that can cause overflow
