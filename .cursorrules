# MealPlanner Development Rules

## NPM Command Safety
- ALWAYS use timeout with npm commands to prevent blocking operations
- Default timeout: 30 seconds for most npm commands
- Extended timeout: 60 seconds for npm install/update operations
- Use format: `timeout 30s npm test` or `timeout 60s npm install`
- If timeout occurs, investigate the issue and use alternative approaches

## Testing Workflow
- Run tests with timeout: `timeout 30s npm test`
- For E2E tests, use: `timeout 60s npm run test:e2e`
- If tests hang, kill processes and investigate root cause
- Always commit passing tests before moving to next milestone

## Development Milestones
- Each roadmap milestone MUST include:
  1. Implementation of feature
  2. Comprehensive behavior tests
  3. All tests passing (timeout 30s npm test)
  4. Version update (node update-version.cjs)
  5. Commit and push to remote
  6. Verification on live site

## Cache Management
- Use cache-busting version system for all assets
- Update versions after each milestone
- Test both local and remote deployment consistency

## PWA Best Practices
- Maintain static site compatibility
- Ensure offline functionality
- Test installation and service worker behavior
- Secure credential storage for OAuth tokens

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

## Code Quality
- Use semantic search for exploration
- Parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
