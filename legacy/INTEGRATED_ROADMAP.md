## Technical Architecture Updates

### **New Data Models Required**

```javascript
// Meal Entity (combines multiple recipes)
class Meal {
    constructor() {
        this.id = null;
        this.name = '';
        this.description = '';
        this.recipes = []; // Array of {recipeId, servings, notes}
        this.totalServings = 0;
        this.estimatedTime = 0;
        this.tags = [];
        this.mealTypes = []; // breakfast, lunch, dinner
        this.createdAt = null;
        this.updatedAt = null;
    }
}

// Enhanced Schedule Entity
class MealSchedule {
    constructor() {
        this.id = null;
        this.name = '';
        this.description = '';
        this.startDate = null;
        this.endDate = null;
        this.status = 'draft'; // draft, ready, published
        this.scheduledMeals = []; // Array of scheduled meal instances
        this.metadata = {
            tags: [],
            template: false,
            lastPublished: null,
            calendarId: null
        };
        this.createdAt = null;
        this.updatedAt = null;
    }
}

// Scheduled Meal Instance
class ScheduledMeal {
    constructor() {
        this.id = null;
        this.scheduleId = null;
        this.mealId = null; // References Meal entity
        this.date = null;
        this.mealType = 'dinner';
        this.servings = 4;
        this.notes = '';
        this.status = 'planned'; // planned, prepared, completed
    }
}
```

### **Database Schema Updates**

    meal_types TEXT, -- JSON array: breakfast, lunch, dinner
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Junction table for meal recipes
CREATE TABLE meal_recipes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    meal_id INTEGER REFERENCES meals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    recipe_id INTEGER REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    servings INTEGER DEFAULT 4,
    notes TEXT,
    order_index INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Enhanced meal schedules table
CREATE TABLE meal_schedules (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,

    status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft', -- draft, ready, published
    is_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    tags TEXT, -- JSON array
    calendar_id TEXT, -- Google Calendar ID if published
    last_published DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Updated scheduled meals to reference meal schedules and meals
CREATE TABLE scheduled_meals (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    schedule_id INTEGER REFERENCES meal_schedules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    meal_id INTEGER REFERENCES meals(id), -- Can be NULL for single-recipe meals
    recipe_id INTEGER REFERENCES recipes(id), -- For backward compatibility
    scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL,
    meal_type TEXT DEFAULT 'dinner',
    servings INTEGER DEFAULT 4,
